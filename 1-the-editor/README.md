## Goal
Unity is a modular, cross-platform 3D Engine with integrations for Ads, Shops, Physics, Multiplayer, Analytics, Visual Scripting, AR, VR nd much more. In this course, you'll learn to make your first steps in the 3D Engine which can be a bit overwhelming in the beginning.

## Instructions
Look for some free assets on the [Unity Asset Store](https://assetstore.unity.com/) and use them to make some cool top-down city with streets, houses, trees or whatever you feel like. Decide, whether you want to use 2D or 3D Assets. Or both. Don't worry about functionality, yet. Just play around with Level Design.
