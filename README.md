## Preclaimer

Build the technical foundation needed for Programming in Unity. We will take a look at the Editor GUI and how we can write Code that we can use within Unity. We will also learn, how Unity's serialization works and how we can utilize it to store the information that we need to store.

## Introduction

This is a two-weeks course to introduce you to Unity Programming. This course will conclude with a small Top-Down Game.
